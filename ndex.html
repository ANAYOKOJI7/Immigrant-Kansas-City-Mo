History of Immigration in Kansas City

1.<b>Before 1880:</b> Early European Settlers
The first immigrants to Kansas City were mainly Germans, Irish, and French. Attracted by agricultural opportunities, they settled in the surrounding countryside. The city began to take shape between 1830 and 1840.
<br>
2.<b>1880–1920:</b> Industrial Immigration
The growth of the railroads and the meatpacking industry attracted immigrant labor from Eastern Europe: Poles, Slovaks, Croats, and Serbs. They established neighborhoods such as Strawberry Hill and Polish Hill.
<br>
3.<b>1910–1950:</b> Arrival of Mexicans
Due to the Mexican Revolution and increasing labor demand, many Mexicans came to work on railroads and in industry. They formed stable communities in Westside (Kansas City, MO) and Armourdale (Kansas City, KS).
<br>
4.<b>1950–1990:</b> Stabilization and Cultural Anchoring
Italians in Columbus Park and Mexicans in Westside solidified their presence. Local community institutions provided essential support to immigrant families.
<br>
5. <b>Since 1990:</b> Global Diversification
The city has welcomed immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Vietnamese, Somali, Indian, and Chinese communities have grown quickly. These groups are now highly involved in entrepreneurship, healthcare, food services, and social work.
<br>
<b>Today</b>
Kansas City is a multicultural city where many organizations support newcomers, such as Della Lamb, Jewish Vocational Service (JVS), Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center, el Centro Inc., Catholic Charities, and RISE KC.
This history—marked by successive waves of hope and resilience—continues to unfold today with every new face.
